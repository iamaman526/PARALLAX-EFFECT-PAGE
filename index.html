        <h2 class="secHeading">MJOLNIR</h2>
        <p class="text">
          One interesting fact about Mjolnir is that it has a special enchantment placed upon it by Odin, which allows the hammer to return to Thor's hand after being thrown. This enchantment is known as the "worthiness enchantment", and it ensures that only Thor is able to wield the hammer and that it always returns to him, no matter where it may be thrown. This has been a signature aspect of Mjolnir in the comics and is a testament to the bond between Thor and his powerful weapon.
          <br />
          <br />
          Mjolnir can only be wielded by those who are worthy: As mentioned, the ability to lift Mjolnir is restricted to those who are deemed worthy by the hammer. This has led to some interesting moments in the comics, such as when characters like Captain America and Beta Ray Bill have been able to lift the hammer.

          <h2 class="desc">JARVIS</h2> </div>
          
          <p class="text">
            JARVIS stands for "Just A Rather Very Intelligent System". It is an artificial intelligence (AI) system  serving as Tony Stark's personal assistant and operating system.

            <br />
            One interesting fact about JARVIS is that it was initially a human butler in the comics, Edwin Jarvis. However, the MCU version of JARVIS was adapted as an AI system to reflect the modern technological era. JARVIS was voiced by actor Paul Bettany in the films, and his character later evolved into the superhero Vision.

            <h2 class="desc">GAMMA RADIATION</h2> </div>
            <p class="text">
          

In the comics, Bruce Banner was exposed to a massive dose of gamma radiation during a gamma bomb test that he was overseeing. The radiation caused a genetic mutation within his body, which ultimately led to him becoming the Hulk.

              <br />
              As the Hulk, Bruce Banner possesses incredible strength and durability, and his powers are often depicted as increasing in proportion to his level of anger or stress. However, the gamma radiation that gave him his powers is also a source of danger, as it can cause his powers to spiral out of control and potentially lead to catastrophic consequences.

                <h2 class="desc">SIX SENSE</h2> </div>
                <p class="text">
                  Spider-Man is often depicted as having a "sixth sense" or a "spider-sense" which allows him to detect danger before it happens. This ability is depicted as a tingling sensation on the back of his neck and is often portrayed as an early warning system for Spider-Man.


                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The spider-sense is an important aspect of Spider-Man's abilities and has helped him to avoid danger and react quickly in a variety of situations. It is not a foolproof ability, however, and can be overwhelmed by particularly powerful or sudden threats.
